Startup application for BYU CS 260 - J4CK3D

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Strava is the world's leading exercise app, allowing users to post information
about their runs, hikes, bike rides and swims, and share it with their friends.
One feature that is severly lacking is the ability to post details about weight
lifting. J4CK3D ("jacked") is a simple interface that allows users to create
posts about their recent gym experience, including the amount of the reps they
did and how much weight they lifted, and to share those posts with others!

### Key Features

* Login in securely through HTTPS
* Create a post, specifying the various exercises performed, the weight, and 
the number of repetitions
* Post workout to a feed of other workouts
* View the feed of workouts
* "Like" the workouts of others on the feed
